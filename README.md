# JASPAR-SEQ-dependent

This repository provides an R-based workflow to identify **sequence-dependent transcription factor binding motifs** using the **JASPAR** database and **Bioconductor** packages. The project implements a reproducible motif-scanning pipeline that retrieves **Position Frequency Matrices (PFMs)** from *JASPAR2022*, performs **PWM-based motif searches** across promoter sequences (both proximal and distal), and summarizes potential regulatory elements influencing gene expression. Built within an R environment, it integrates tools such as **TFBSTools**, **Biostrings**, **dplyr**, and **rmarkdown** for motif analysis, visualization, and report generation. The initial focus is on the **ABCB1 gene**, widely known for its role in multidrug resistance. In subsequent stages, the repository will expand to include **functional enrichment** through **GO and KEGG pathway analyses**, followed by **network-level exploration** using **STRINGdb**, to uncover the biological pathways and transcriptional regulators underlying gene control mechanisms.
